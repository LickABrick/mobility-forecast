## Current phase

Phase 1 — architecture, contracts and safe development foundation.

## Completed

- C0 established the local repository, safety/privacy governance, Apache-2.0 intent, Conventional Commits and deterministic checkpoint tooling.
- C1 defined the V1 outcome, architecture boundaries and ADRs 0001–0005.
- C2 added dependency-free, frozen and typed domain values for normalized source events, coordinates/resolved locations, directional successful routes, passive vehicle observations, degraded trips, shared quality states and uncertainty-aware daily forecasts.
- C2 made privacy-bearing event text and coordinates absent from object representations, rejects naive/reversed event time ranges and invalid numeric measurements, and prevents a failed route from being represented as a zero-valued successful route.
- C2 established Python/package metadata, Ruff and Pyright policy, a standard-library `unittest` foundation and checkpoint execution of the test suite.

## Active checkpoint

C3 — Calendar filtering and preview semantics.

Next bounded checkpoint: use TDD to add deterministic include/exclude rules and privacy-safe aggregate preview results for synthetic normalized events, including online, all-day and missing-location semantics. Do not resolve locations, call route providers or expose private event fields in previews.

```

The C2 test suite uses only synthetic identifiers and coordinates and makes no network, Home Assistant, route-provider or vehicle-service calls. Ruff, Pyright and pytest executables are not installed in the local environment; C2 uses the standard library test runner, while tool policy is recorded in `pyproject.toml` for later CI/bootstrap work.

Configuration review for C2: `pyproject.toml` now explicitly sets pre-alpha project metadata, Apache-2.0, Python 3.13 compatibility and Ruff/Pyright policy. The pure package lives under `custom_components/mobility_forecast`, includes `py.typed`, and has no runtime dependencies or build backend. `.gitignore`, package inclusion and test discovery were reviewed; no additional ignore or test configuration was needed. Home Assistant `manifest.json`, `hacs.json`, strings/translations, workflows, config-flow schemas and storage schemas remain intentionally absent until their planned checkpoints. No Home Assistant option, schema version, threshold or behavioral default was introduced.

## Current decisions

- Name/domain: Mobility Forecast / `mobility_forecast`.
- License/delivery: Apache-2.0 clean-room implementation, HACS-first.
- Config model: one isolated config entry per forecast profile; multiple entries supported.
- V1 is read-only/advisory and excludes notifications, price/solar optimization and every physical action.
- Start and end locations use independent policies. Dynamic vehicle location is passive, freshness/quality gated and fallback based; no wake or refresh request is allowed.
- The domain uses provider-neutral typed boundaries. Google Routes is the intended first production route adapter; unattended tests use deterministic fakes only.
- Route and input failures remain partial, stale or unavailable and never become zero distance or false readiness.
- Historical plan revisions are immutable so later calendar edits do not rewrite training truth.
- Domain value objects are frozen and dependency-free. Operational private fields remain available to pure logic but are omitted from representations to reduce accidental logging.

## Remaining risks and deferred details

- C2 defines value contracts, not event filtering, endpoint-resolution policy, provider failure/cache protocols, itinerary assembly or forecast algorithms; those remain C3–C7 work.
- Route currently models only a successful positive route. Typed provider failures and deterministic fake-provider behavior remain explicitly deferred to C5.
- Domain representations reduce accidental disclosure but do not replace the dedicated diagnostics/log redaction boundary and tests required at C8.
- Python 3.13 compatibility is explicit, but CI has not yet exercised Ruff or Pyright because those tools and workflows are deferred to C9.
- Numeric freshness thresholds, future-trip horizon, unknown accuracy and fallback precedence are deliberately deferred to tested C4 configuration.
- Storage/config-entry schema versions, migrations and diagnostics redaction implementation remain unbuilt.
- No production Home Assistant mount or isolated HA development environment is configured.
- No GitHub remote/authentication is available; work remains local.
- No real route-provider credentials or calls are permitted during unattended work.
- Exact Home Assistant entity selections and personal data are deliberately absent from the repository.

## Nightly runtime

- Hard deadline: 2026-08-26 03:01 CEST.
- OpenAI session and weekly usage are queried through Hermes' read-only account-usage implementation.
- Safety floor: stop/pause at 15% remaining; do not redeem the banked reset.
- Morning report scheduled for 08:00 CEST.
